#Location Intelligence
Food trucks are a staple for many people especially during lunch. They operate on a business model that depends on the location. Food truck in general, offer similar lunch options at approximately the same price, which makes it difficult for businesses to distinguish themselves from nearby competitors. The location of food trucks can therefore determine whether a company succeeds or fails.

# Data
Data will be retreived from   :https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_postal_codes_of_Canada:_M
A dataframe of boroughs with related coordinates will be created and the the Foursquare API:  https://developer.foursquare.com will be used to explore each borough to retreive locations of different venues.

The venues of the neighborhoods will then be clustered together using K-means clustering based on defining categories.
